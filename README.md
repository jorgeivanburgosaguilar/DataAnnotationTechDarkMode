## FAQ

1. Do you accept pull requests?
   - Yes
2. Why do you have Intel One Mono as an font option?
   - Because its my personal choice, it helps me focus and improves readbility. [If you have trouble focusing/reading this font might help you, it was desgined by Intel for optimized legibility.](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/company-overview/one-monospace-font.html)
3. Is it ok to use these type of enhacements?
   - Asked support about this and were mostly ok, i just can't share the design of the task ui.
