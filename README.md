## FAQ

1. Do you accept pull requests?
   - Yes
2. Why do you have Intel One Mono as an font option?
   - It is my personal preference as it enhances focus and improves readability. If you find it difficult to focus or read, [this font](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/company-overview/one-monospace-font.html) might be beneficial. It was designed by Intel to optimize legibility.
3. Is this better than dark reader add-on?
   - No, this is just a personal alternative, developed and maintained by me to improve my work UI.
